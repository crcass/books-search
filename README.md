# Google Books Search

## Technology

This app was built with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [MongooseJS](https://mongoosejs.com/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), & [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

## Concept

A website that allows users to search for printed media through the Google Books API, save an item's information for future reference, view their saved items, and remove items from their list.

## Motivation

This project was an exercise to build a full-stack React website. I wanted to combine my knowledge of API calls through Axios, Express routing, and my MongoDB skills into a React app. I also wanted to continue improving my knowledge and understand of styled-components and push myself to take some chances on styling & design while remaining simple to use.

## Design Process

I was provided a greyscale wireframe for the general layout with no other directions for colors, fonts, etc. I intially focused on getting the API calls working and displaying the information in the console. Once that was working, I decided to write some code that filters the API call to only give me the info that I need. With the API call providing the info I needed, it was a simple process to get that info on the page.

I also wanted to explore design features using gradients. Creating transitions that change the gradient when the user hovers over the buttons was an interesting challenge that expanded my understanding of how CSS and gradients work.

## Future Development

- Authentication with Google Account. This would allow individual users to have their own set of saved items. Currently, there is only one universal list.
- Refine styling. The styling is a bit polarizing at the moment and could be refined.

## Known Issues

- Occasionally, CSS transitions fail to display properly the first time they are displayed.
